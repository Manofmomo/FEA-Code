# FEA-Code
This project is aimed at implementing a open source FEA analyser for an input geometry using Matlab and Python
## Objectives: 
->Develop Code similar to preexisting software to make efficient FEM calculations for simplified 2D geometries for structural (possibly thermal) use cases

->Start with finite element method for bolted joint assembly

->Figure out how to generalise to geometry 

->Add an interactive way to input geometry 

->Add more components to the analysis as the course continues 

->Realistic First Goal: Given 2D geometry should be able to solve SOM Force 

->Realistic Second Goal: Given 2D geometry should solve vibration and things like that 

->Readlistic End goal: Simple interface for 3D geometry and solves a variety of problems
